title: Get started with App Toolbox
---

Getting up and running with App Toolbox is simple.

1.   Install the [Polymer CLI](/{{{polymer_version_dir}}}/docs/tools/polymer-cli).
      (Polymer CLI requires Node.js and Bower. For full installation instructions, see the [Polymer CLI docs](/{{{polymer_version_dir}}}/docs/tools/polymer-cli).)

    npm install -g polytool

2.   Create a new App Toolbox project.

      Create a new directory for your project. Run the following command in the new directory:

    polymer init toolbox

3.   Start the development server.

    polymer serve

You should now be able to see a basic app shell running on `localhost:8080`.
