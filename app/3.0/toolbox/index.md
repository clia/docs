Polymer App Toolbox is a collection of components, tools and templates for
building
[Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps)
with Polymer. App Toolbox features:

-   Component-based architecture using Polymer and web components.
-   Responsive design using the [app layout components](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-layout).
-   Modular routing using the
    [`<app-route>`](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-route) elements.
-   Localization with [`<app-localize-behavior>`](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-localize-behavior).	
-   Turnkey support for local storage with [app storage elements](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-storage).
-   Offline caching as a progressive enhancement, using service workers.
-   Build tooling to support serving your app multiple ways: unbundled for
    delivery over HTTP/2 with server push, and bundled for delivery over HTTP/1.


You can use any one of these components separately, or use them together to build a full-featured
progressive web app. Most importantly, each component is _additive_. For a simple app you may only
need app-layout. As it gets more complicated, you can add routing, offline caching, and a
high-performance server as required.

To get a feel for these components in action, you can try out one of the two demo apps:

-   [商店](https://shop.polymer-project.org/)。商店是一个使用工具箱构建的功能齐全的电子商务渐进式 Web App 演示。了解如何构建
    [案例研究：商店 App](case-study)。

-   [新闻](https://news.polymer-project.org/)。新闻是一个功能齐全的渐进式 Web App 演示，像商店一样，但专注于发布。了解如何构建
    [案例研究：新闻 App](news-case-study)。
