Polymer App Toolbox is a collection of components, tools and templates for
building
[Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps)
with Polymer. App Toolbox features:

-   Component-based architecture using Polymer and web components.
-   Responsive design using the [app layout components](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-layout).
-   Modular routing using the
    [`<app-route>`](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-route) elements.
-   Localization with [`<app-localize-behavior>`](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-localize-behavior).	
-   Turnkey support for local storage with [app storage elements](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-storage).
-   Offline caching as a progressive enhancement, using service workers.
-   Build tooling to support serving your app multiple ways: unbundled for
    delivery over HTTP/2 with server push, and bundled for delivery over HTTP/1.


You can use any one of these components separately, or use them together to build a full-featured
progressive web app. Most importantly, each component is _additive_. For a simple app you may only
need app-layout. As it gets more complicated, you can add routing, offline caching, and a
high-performance server as required.

To get a feel for these components in action, you can try out one of the two demo apps:

-   [Shop](https://shop.polymer-project.org/). Shop is a full-featured e-commerce progressive
    web app demo built using the Toolbox. Read about how it's built in
    [Case study: the Shop app](case-study).

-   [News](https://news.polymer-project.org/). News is a full-featured progressive
    web app demo like Shop, but focusing on publishing. Read about how it's built in
    [Case study: the News app](news-case-study).
