* [Learn how to build your first element with the Polymer library](/{{{polymer_version_dir}}}/start/first-element/intro)

Polymer is distributed via the [Bower package manager](https://bower.io/).

To create an application template and install Polymer automatically, you can [use the Polymer CLI](#use-cli).

To start a project from scratch, you can [install Polymer with Bower](#use-bower).

The Polymer CLI requires Node.js, npm, Git and Bower. For full installation instructions, see [the Polymer CLI documentation](../docs/tools/polymer-cli).

1. Install the Polymer CLI.

    ```bash
    npm install -g polymer-cli
    ```

3. Create a test folder for Polymer 2.0, and switch to it.

    ```bash
    mkdir polymer-20-test
    cd polymer-20-test
    ```

4. Initialize your project.

    ```bash
    polymer init
    ```

  - `<script src="/bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js"></script>` to
  load the polyfills
  - `<link rel="import" href="/bower_components/polymer/polymer.html">` to
  import Polymer

5. Import and use whichever elements youâ€™d like.

6. Serve your project.

    ```bash
    polymer serve
    ```
