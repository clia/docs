The [Polymer App Toolbox][toolbox] is a collection of components, tools and
templates for building Progressive Web Apps with Polymer.

Follow the instructions below to install, build, and deploy a project using an
App Toolbox template in less than 15 minutes.

## Install Polymer CLI

Polymer CLI is an all-in-one command line tool for Polymer projects. In this tutorial you use
Polymer CLI to initialize, serve, and build your project. You can also use it for linting and
testing, but this tutorial won't cover those topics.

To work with Polymer CLI, you will need a Node.js version [supported by the Polymer toolset](/{{{polymer_version_dir}}}/docs/tools/node-support), npm, Git, and Yarn. For full installation instructions, see [the
Polymer CLI documentation](/{{{polymer_version_dir}}}/docs/tools/polymer-cli).

Once you have the prerequisites set up, install Polymer CLI:

    npm install -g polymer-cli

## Initialize your project from a template

1. Create a new project folder to start from.

        mkdir my-app
        cd my-app

1. Initialize your project with an app template.

        polymer init

    Press the down arrow until `polymer-3-starter-kit` is highlighted and press the enter / return
    key to select.

Polymer CLI downloads and installs dependencies, and creates an app from the `polymer-3-starter-kit template`.

## Serve your project

The App Toolbox templates do not require any build steps to get started
developing.  You can serve the application using the Polymer CLI, and
file changes you make will be immediately visible by refreshing
your browser.

To serve your project:

    polymer serve

The output of the `polymer serve` command tells you where your app is served. In a web browser, open the URL shown at `applications`. For example:

```
~/my-app > polymer serve
info: [cli.command.serve]    Files in this directory are available under the following URLs
      applications: http://127.0.0.1:8081
      reusable components: http://127.0.0.1:8081/components/polymer-starter-kit/
```

## Project structure

The diagram below is a brief summary of the files and directories within
the project.

```text

package-lock.json      # dependency management file generated by npm
package.json           # npm metadata file
polymer.json           # Polymer CLI configuration
