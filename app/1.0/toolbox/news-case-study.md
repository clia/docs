This case study shows how News uses the principles of Progressive Web App (PWA) design to deliver a
great
user experience.

## App structure

Like other PWAs, News is designed with an [application shell
architecture](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell). The app shell
element, `<news-app>`, contains the main framework for News. Here's the basic structure:

<div class="image-container layout horizontal">
  <div class="image-wrapper">
    <img src="/images/1.0/toolbox/app-structure.png" alt="app structure" width="600px">
  </div>
</div>

* `<news-app>` lays out the structure for the application.
* `<app-route>` contains routing logic that parses the user's selected URL.
* `<news-data>` fetches resources from the raw HTML files and images in the /data/ folder and its
subfolders.
* `<iron-pages>` switches between the News application's two views - list view and article view.
* `<news-list>` is the application's *list view*.
* `<news-article>` is the application's *article view*.

  <div class="image-wrapper">

  </div>
  <div class="image-wrapper">
    <img src="/images/1.0/toolbox/news-article.png" alt="screenshot of the article view" width="300px">
  </div>
</div>

## Views and routing

Views in the News app use the same implementation as the Shop app. [See the Shop app case study for
more information on views and
routing](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/toolbox/case-study#views).

For more information on encapsulated routing, see [Encapsulated routing with
elements](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/blog/routing).

For more information on the `<app-route>` Polymer element used in these implementations, see the
[`<app-route>` API reference](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-route).

There are two main views in the News app. The `<news-list>` element displays a list of articles for
the selected category - for example, Top Stories. The `<news-article>` element displays article
content. When the user is offline and the category data is not cached, both views display a network
error via the `<news-network-warning>` element:

`news-list.html`
{.caption}
```html
<news-network-warning
    hidden$="[[!failure]]"
    offline="[[offline]]"
    on-try-reconnect="_tryReconnect"></news-network-warning>
```

If the user is offline but category data is cached and ServiceWorker is installed,
the cached content is displayed.

## Routing and data binding in the News app

Routing and data bindings work together in the News app to retrieve and display the data relevant
to the URL that the user selects.

Polymer's data system allows for data to flow one-way (downward-only, from host element to target
element) or two-way (from host to target and target to host). For more information on data binding
in Polymer, see [Data binding](../docs/devguide/data-binding).

The News app uses both one-way and two-way binding to transfer data between elements.

The app shell element, `<news-app>`, acts as the host, while `<news-data>`, `<news-list>`, and
`<news-article>` act as targets. `<news-app>` contains data properties for:

* The name of the current category (`categoryName`)
* The ID of the current article (`articleId`)
* The list of articles in the current category (`category`)
* The raw HTML for the current article (`article`)

### Part 1: Routing

`categoryName` and `articleId` are set by the routing logic in the view elements (`<news-list>` and
`<news-article>`). The active view element processes the user's selected URL in order to set
`categoryName` or `articleId`. The properties are two-way bound between the view elements and the
app shell, so they are "pushed" up to the app shell.

For example, here's how the URL `/list/top_stories` would be processed.

The top-level `<app-route>` element in `<news-app>` consumes the first part of the URL, and `page`
is set to `"list"`:

`news-app.html`
{.caption}
```html
<app-location route="{{route}}"></app-location>
<app-route
    route="{{route}}"
    pattern="/:page"
    data="{{routeData}}"
    tail="{{subroute}}"></app-route>
```

The `<iron-pages>` element in `<news-app>` displays the `<news-list>` element (because `page` ==
"list"):

`news-app.html`
{.caption}
```html
<iron-pages role="main" selected="[[page]]" attr-for-selected="name">
```

The `<app-route>` element in `<news-list>` consumes the next part of the URL (`/top-stories`), and
sets `categoryName` to `top-stories`:

`news-list.html`
{.caption}
```html
<app-route
    route="[[route]]"
    pattern="/:category"
    data="{{_routeData}}"></app-route>
```

Two-way data binding in the host element ensures that the data is passed back to `<news-app>`:

`news-app.html`
{.caption}
```html
<news-list
    ...
    category-name="{{categoryName}}"
    ...
    ...></news-list>
```

### Part 2: Data retrieval

`categoryName` and `articleId` are one-way bound from `<news-app>` to `<news-data>`:

`news-app.html`
{.caption}
```html
<news-data
    ...
    category-name="[[categoryName]]"
    article-id="[[articleId]]"
    ...
    ...></news-data>
```

These properties tell `<news-data>` which resources to retrieve. `<news-data>` then creates an
`XMLHttpRequest` for the relevant resources, and stores the resulting category or article
information in its `category` and `article` properties.

For example, if the user has visited `/list/top_stories`, `categoryName` is set to `top_stories`.
`<news-data>` queries `/data/top_stories.json` and retrieves a list of the articles in the
`top_stories` category. This list is stored in `category`.

The `category` and `article` properties are two-way bound from `<news-app>` to `<news-data>`, and
therefore propagate back to `<news-app>`:

`news-app.html`
{.caption}
```html
<news-data
    ...
    category="{{category}}"
    ...
    article="{{article}}"
    ...
    ...></news-data>
```

### Part 3: Data display

`category` and `article` are one-way bound from `<news-app>` to the elements that display this
content (`<news-list>` and `<news-article>`. When these properties are updated in `<news-app>`,
triggered by their change of state in `<news-data>`, they flow down to `<news-list>` or
`<news-article>`, depending on routing.

For example, if the user has visited `/list/top_stories`, `<news-data>` has populated
`<news-app>`'s `category` object with a list of articles in the `top_stories` category. The data
now propagates to `<news-list>` through one-way data binding:

`news-app.html`
{.caption}
```html
<news-list
    ...
    category="[[category]]"
    ...
    ...></news-list>
```

These relationships are shown here:

</div>

This sequence diagram shows the interactions between the elements of the News app when the user
visits `/list/top_stories`:

</div>

## Resource URLs

Resource URLs, like `/bower_components/`, `/data/` and `/src/` are served as static files. These
static URLs are defined in `app.yaml`. These URLs are used internally by the app to load components
and data.

## Displaying ads

The News app attempts to display ads, without blocking a fast first paint.

The `<news-iframe>` element uses
[`IntersectionObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
, a web platform API. `IntersectionObserver` is used to determine whether `<news-iframe>` element
is visible on screen before creating an iframe that will display an ad.

`news-iframe.html`
{.caption}
```javascript
attached: function() {
  if ('IntersectionObserver' in window) {
    this._io = new IntersectionObserver(this._createIframe.bind(this));
    this._io.observe(this);
  } else {
    // Intersection Observer is not available, so just create the iframe
    // after a bit of a delay.
    window.setTimeout(this._createIframe.bind(this), 100);
  }
},
```

If `IntersectionObserver` isn't available, the application briefly delays displaying the ad to let
the rest of the page load first.

## AMP version of the News app

We built a [version of the News app](https://github.com/Polymer/news/tree/amp) for integration
with [AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)](https://www.ampproject.org/) documents. In the AMP version of
News, the HTML content files (for example, `/data/articles/it-takes-teacher.html`) are replaced by
AMP documents which can be loaded as standalone pages.

<a href="https://polymer-news-amp.appspot.com/" target="_blank" class="blue-button">Launch News-AMP demo</a>

The AMP project supports adding an AMP document to a shadow root on your page. Hereâ€™s an example:

[https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/examples/pwa/pwa.js](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/examples/pwa/pwa.js)

To support this in the AMP version of the News app, we created [the `<amp-viewer>`
element](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/amp-viewer/). The `<amp-viewer>` element works similarly to
an iframe. To load an AMP document inside the viewer, set its `src` attribute to the URL of the AMP
document. Styles will be applied to the content, scoped by its shadow root.

The element is written as a native custom element, and can be used independently of the News app.

Here's how the `<amp-viewer>` element is used in News:

`news-article.html`
{.caption}
```html
<div class="container" fade-in$="[[!loading]]" hidden$="[[failure]]">
  <article class="flex">
    <amp-viewer id="ampViewer" src="[[_getArticleSrc(article.id)]]"></amp-viewer>
  </article>
```

Note: the AMP version of the app does not support swiping between articles. Doing so would require
loading the title, image and author of the previous or next article. In the AMP version of News,
that data is only loaded when the article content is loaded. It is not loaded with the list of
articles.
