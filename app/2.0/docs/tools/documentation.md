Polymer 2.x code can be documented using JSDoc-style comments, like Polymer 1.x code.
Documentation tools for Polymer 2.x are still under development. Information about the
new documentation tools will be available in a future release.

The Polymer 1.x tools (specifically, `iron-component-page`) won't work for Polymer 2.x,
but the general documentation rules are the same as that described in
[Document your elements](/1.0/docs/tools/documentation) in the Polymer 1.x docs.
