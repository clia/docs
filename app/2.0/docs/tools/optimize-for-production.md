[Polymer CLI](polymer-cli) is the recommended starting point for building
Polymer applications. If for some reason it does not meet your needs, you
can use the underlying libraries that power its build toolchain. See
[Advanced tools](advanced#build) for a list of these tools.

See the [polymer.json specification](polymer-json) for a reference to the available Polymer CLI
build options.

This document will be updated with more information on using the advanced build tools in the
Polymer 2.x toolchain.
