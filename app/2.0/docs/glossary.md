## A

### Analyzer
See [Polymer Analyzer](#polymer-analyzer).

### app shell
In a progressive web app, the app shell contains the CSS, HTML and JavaScript that implements the 
UI framework common to the whole app. This can include headers, footers, menus and routing logic. 
It excludes any functionality that is specific to a route. As such, the app shell contains the code 
that surrounds the rest of the content. 

The [Polymer CLI](#polymer-cli) is designed to work with apps that use an app shell architecture. 
See [Instant Loading Web Apps with an Application Shell 
Architecture](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/11/app-shell) for more information.

## B
### Bower
Bower is a package manager for web projects. Bower automates the installation of packages like 
custom elements and JavaScript libraries. Polymer distributes its core library and elements via 
Bower. See [bower.io](https://bower.io) for more information.

### bower.json
`bower.json` is a manifest used by Bower for configuring packages for use as dependencies. See [the 
`bower.json` specification](https://github.com/bower/spec/blob/master/json.md) for more information.

## C
### crisper
crisper extracts inline scripts from an HTML file. crisper is useful for separating JavaScript from 
HTML in order to deploy in an environment that uses CSP (Content Security Policy).

## D
### dependency

*dependency* may refer to:

* A package dependency, such as a Bower or npm package that your project uses.
* A specific resource that is required by another, such as HTML files or JavaScript libraries. See 
also: [dynamic dependency](#dynamic-dependency), [static dependency](#static-dependency), 
[transitive dependency](#transitive-dependency).
* A data dependency in the context of the Polymer data system: a piece of data that an observer, 
computed property or computed binding depends on.

### dependency variants

Dependency variants are named sets of Bower [package dependencies](#dependency) at specific 
versions which are different (usually more specific) than the default dependencies. Variants are 
specified in [`bower.json`](#bower-json).

Dependency variants are useful for testing elements against different versions of Polymer and other 
elements, where [`bower.json`](#bower-json) would normally only let you install and test against 
one version.

If you run `polymer install --variants`, the `polymer install` tool creates separate builds for 
your element using the versions of Polymer you specify. You can use the [Polymer development 
server](#polyserve) to test these variants. 

### dynamic dependency
A dynamic dependency is a dependency that is imported at runtime, using a mechanism such as 
`importHref`. Compare [static dependency](#static-dependency).

## E
### eager loading
Eager loading refers to the process of loading dependencies statically, rather than on demand. 
Compare [lazy loading](#lazy-loading).

### entry point
The HTML actually loaded by the browser to start the application. Usually `index.html`. In an 
application built with an [app shell](#app-shell) architecture, the entrypoint is loaded for many 
different URLs.

## F
### fragment
Fragments are used to define bundles and are often associated with routes or non-critical 
resources. A fragment is a lazily-loaded HTML file. 

## G
### git
A distributed version control system. Bower depends on git to install components from their GitHub 
repositories.

### gulp
A streamed JavaScript task runner that can be used to set up a custom build process using the 
[`polymer-build` library](#polymer-build).

## H
### hydrolysis
This tool has been replaced by [Polymer Analyzer](#polymer-analyzer). It is a static analysis 
framework for Web Components. 

## L
### lazy loading
Lazy loading takes advantage of routing to load elements only when they are required for render. 
Used correctly, lazy loading can improve performance.

For an example implementation of lazily-loaded elements, see the [Shop 
app](https://github.com/Polymer/shop). In the Shop app, views are elements which are instantiated 
only when they are routed to. 

### linter
A linter is a piece of software that analyzes code for suspicious-looking constructions that can 
potentially cause errors; for example, for example, registering an element without specifying its 
tag name, or using invalid data-binding syntax. The Polymer tools include [`Polymer 
Linter`](#polymer-linter), which does this for Polymer apps and elements.

## M
### monolithic
A monolithic app is one that loads all of its code statically and does not use an app shell 
architecture or dynamic code loading.

## N
### Node.js
An event-driven JavaScript runtime environment. The [Polymer CLI](#polymer-cli) and [bower](#bower) 
are both built on Node. For more information, visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

### npm
Package management system for [Node.js](#node-js).

## P
### package.json
A metadata file used by [npm](#npm) to manage project dependencies.

### Polymer CLI
A command line tool for Polymer projects. The Polymer CLI has a number of tools for working with 
Polymer and Web Components. For more information, see the [Polymer CLI documentation](/{{{polymer_version_dir}}}/docs/tools/polymer-cli).

#### `polymer build`
This command builds your project with a preconfigured build pipeline. It calls `polymer-build` with 
options configured for a build suitable for an [app shell](#app-shell) app.

To customize your build pipeline, you can use `polymer-build` itself in conjunction with other 
build tools.

#### `polymer init`
Initializes a Polymer project. Contains a set of starter templates for elements and apps. 

#### `polymer install`
Install command for Polymer apps. Installs [Bower](#bower) dependencies, equivalent to running 
`bower install`. With the option `--variants`, also installs any [dependency 
variants](#dependency-variants) specified in the `variants` property of [`bower.json`](#bower-json).

#### `polymer lint`
Invokes [`polymer-linter`](#polymer-linter) to [lint](#linter) a polymer project.

#### `polymer serve`
This command starts [`polyserve`](#polyserve), a simple development server for Web Components.

#### `polymer test`
Runs tests for your Polymer app with [`web-component-tester`](#web-component-tester).

### polymer-build
`polymer-build` is a library for building Polymer projects. `polymer-build` allows you to 
completely customize your build and combine additional streams and build tasks in any order. 

Compare the `polymer build` command, which calls `polymer-build` with preconfigured options. 

### Polymer Bundler
Polymer build tool that follows HTML Imports and `<script>` tags to concatenate resources into a 
single page for production. Can improve performance by reducing network trips.

### Polymer Linter
[Linter](#linter) invoked by `polymer lint` command. Lints a Polymer project.

### Polymer Analyzer
A static analysis framework for web applications. 

### `polymer.json`
`polymer.json` is the Polymer build configuration file. It lets you configure your appâ€™s entrypoint 
and app shell files, instead of passing these as parameters to polymer build.

`polymer.json` also lets you specify the locations of source files, HTML fragments and additional 
dependencies, and configure the [Polymer linter](#polymer-linter).

### `polyserve`
`polyserve` is a locally-installable web server for developing [Bower](#bower) components. 

## R
### routing
Routing is the process an app uses to determine how to respond to a client request for a particular 
endpoint. A default route is the endpoint the app directs the user to when no route is specified. 
In a PWA, the [app shell](#app-shell) performs routing.

## S
### service worker

A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, 
opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Today, they already 
include features like push notifications and background sync.

For progressive web applications, a service worker can help to make an application usable offline 
in a meaningful way. For example, on first accessing a particular site, a service worker could 
fetch a defined set of resources and cache them. Then, the service worker could act as a 
client-side proxy, intercepting network requests for resources. Where possible, the service worker 
could supply those resources from the browser cache. 

### static dependency
A [dependency](#dependency) that is required by a given file, and whose import is hard-coded using 
syntax like `<link rel="import">` or `<script src="...">`. This dependency will always be loaded 
when the given file is loaded.

### transitive dependency

A transitive dependency is an indirect dependency - that is, a resource that is depended on by 
another dependency.

For example, if file A depends on file B, and file B depends on file C, then file C is a transitive 
dependency of file A. 

The *transitive dependencies* of a resource are all the dependencies, direct and indirect, that a 
resource depends on.

## V
### variant
See [dependency variant](#dependency-variant).

### vulcanize
This tool has been replaced by [Polymer Bundler](#polymer-bundler).

## W
### web-component-tester
A browser-based testing environment for web components. Runs your tests in local browsers or 
remotely via Sauce.
