title:  "Introducing the Polymer Project Roadmap and Repo"
---

We've been seeing exponential Polymer adoption since the [Polymer 1.0 release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD2As5RmM8Q) and the [Polymer Summit](https://www.polymer-project.org/summit), and couldn't be more excited about where the project is headed.

We're working hard to better communicate the core team's goals and roadmap. Today we're excited to announce a new repository - [Polymer/project](https://github.com/Polymer/project) - where we'll keep all meta-information about the project itself. This includes a [Roadmap](https://github.com/Polymer/project/blob/master/Roadmap.md), [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Polymer/project/blob/master/Code_of_Conduct.md), and [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Polymer/project/blob/master/Contributing.md).

We decided on a repository rather than Wiki primarily to open up broader discussion about the project structure and direction. The Polymer project consists of many different repos, of which [Polymer/polymer](https://github.com/polymer/polymer) is only a small part. It can sometimes be hard to know where on Github these kinds of collaborative, project-level discussions can take place.

The new [Polymer/project](https://github.com/Polymer/project) repository should make this much clearer. If you have project-level questions, concerns, ideas, or issues, please file them as [issues on the new Project repo](https://github.com/Polymer/project/issues).

The [Polymer/project](https://github.com/Polymer/project) repo will be a living document, and continue to evolve - so feel free to star the repo to follow changes as they happen. And like any of the Polymer project repos - PR's welcome!
