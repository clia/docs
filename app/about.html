        <h2 class="underline">我们是谁</h2>

        <p>Polymer 项目是由谷歌 Chrome 组织内的前端开发团队领导的一个开源项目。</p>

        <h2 class="underline">我们的使命</h2>

        <p>我们的使命是通过帮助开发人员释放 Web 平台的全部潜力，激发 Web 平台的发展和完善，为用户和开发人员提供更好的生活。</p>

        <p>为追求这一使命，我们开发出库、工具和模式，以帮助开发人员构建现代化的<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">渐进式 Web 应用</a>，充分利用 <a href="http://webcomponents.org/">Web 组件</a>，<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/">服务工作者</a>和 <a href="https://http2.github.io/">HTTP/2</a> 等尖端平台功能。</p>

        <p>我们还与 Chrome 开发团队的同事紧密合作，确定痛点，将新的平台功能用于实测，并尽力确保前端开发人员在平台发展中拥有强有力的话语权。</p>

        <p>我们的座右铭，反映了我们独特的使命，是 <strong>#UseThePlatform</strong>。对我们来说这一点值得解释几句。</p>

        <h2 class="underline">为什么 #UseThePlatform？</h2>

        <p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> 我们相信，拥抱现代 Web 平台是向用户和开发人员提供应有的最佳方式。</p>

        <p>用户需要快速启动的应用，可以立即响应，并可在任何网络条件下随时随地从各种类型和大小的设备上进行访问。</p>

        <p>开发人员应该得到一个可以与之合作的平台，而非围着它打转——一个易于构建，分发和维护这些普遍可访问，可靠，令人愉快的高性能应用的平台。</p>

        <p>但是，我们并不总是从 Web 上得到我们应得的，尤其是在移动领域。</p>

        <ul>
          <li><p>从用户的角度来看，太多的移动 Web 应用启动缓慢，与本地应用相比表现不佳，并且在网络条件差的情况下根本不工作。</p></li>
          <li><p>对于应用开发人员来说，Web 平台进展缓慢。多年来，我们不得不在平台上插入洞孔，并在其上构建层，以满足基本需求，如定义组件和加载模块。</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="underline">给予应得荣誉</h2>

        <p>我们为弥补 Web 平台缺陷而建立的库，工具和框架，证明了 Web 的基本可扩展性以及 Web 社区不断创新的精神。</p>

        <p>这些创新在 Web 从内容平台到支持功能强大，功能丰富的应用的平台变迁时发挥了重要作用。毫无疑问，我们在“用户空间”中的集体努力将继续清扫和照亮前进的道路。</p>

        <p>也就是说，我们已在平台本身以外做得太多，有实际的代价需要支付——开发者和用户都需要支付的代价。</p>

        <h2 class="underline">Developer costs</h2>

        <p>Developer costs come in the form of complexity and lock-in.</p>

        <p>Over time, the stacks we’ve built on top of the platform have pushed web development further and further from the simplicity of view-source and shift-refresh, to a place where every project begins with an overwhelming sea of choices.</p>

        <p>And when we rely on libraries and frameworks for even our most basic needs, we end up writing code that depends on opinionated abstractions rather than universal platform primitives. Because it’s expensive to migrate from one abstraction to another, these dependencies limit our future choices and make our code costlier to maintain.</p>

        <h2 class="underline">User costs</h2>

        <p>More importantly, users pay a performance penalty when the layers we build above the platform become too thick.</p>

        <p>Every byte of code that we send over the wire consumes bandwidth that could be used for content and data, and every tick we spend executing JavaScript on the client reduces our apps’ responsiveness. This is especially true on the far reaches of the mobile web, where poor connections and underpowered devices are the norm.</p>

        <p>Many of the development patterns that we use today originated in an era when we used the web mostly from the desktop. Now that the web is mobile-first, we need to reconsider those patterns. Giving our users the experience they deserve in the hyper-constrained mobile environment means aggressively minimizing bandwidth and execution cost, leaning heavily on the platform and saving our limited budget for things that only our applications can provide.</p>

        <p>For example, the browser specializes in loading resources, parsing native web formats like HTML and CSS, and caching them for maximum efficiency. Similarly, the browser has highly optimized native code for instantiating elements, inserting them in the DOM, updating their properties and attributes, managing the flow of events between them, and eventually tearing them down.</p>

        <p>When we write our own code to do these things, send that code over the network and execute it on the client, we are doing work we shouldn’t have to do; and in some cases, we are also negating current and future browser-side optimizations.</p>

        <h2 class="underline">A platform-centric path forward</h2>

        <p>Thanks to new web platform primitives, many of the needs we’ve addressed by building over and around the platform can now be met by the platform itself:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><p>Web Components let us extend the browser’s built-in component model—the DOM—rather than bring our own.</p></li>

          <li><p>In combination with HTTP/2 and server push, standard module formats like <a href="http://webcomponents.org/articles/introduction-to-html-imports/">HTML Imports</a> and <a href="http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html">ES6 Modules</a> let us declare fine-grained dependencies and efficiently deliver them to the client in optimally cacheable form, without relying on complicated packaging tools and loaders.</p></li>

          <li><p>Service Workers let us build pure web apps that users can access even when their devices are offline or network conditions are poor, whereas previously we might have had to resort to manually installable native or “hybrid” apps.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>We believe that in the next era, the best-performing apps will be those that take full advantage of these modern web platform features and let the browser do the heavy lifting wherever it can. Similarly, the least costly, most future-proof apps will be those that build as much as possible on platform primitives, maximizing interoperability and minimizing switching costs.</p>

        <h2 class="underline">Rethinking libraries and frameworks</h2>

        <p>Using the platform doesn’t mean leaving libraries and frameworks behind; it just means making them lighter, and designing them to complement the strengths of the platform itself.</p>

        <p>At their best, libraries and frameworks make our jobs easier. They provide off-the-shelf solutions for hard problems; broadly applicable abstractions that save us from reinventing the wheel; and useful patterns and constraints to help us structure our apps intelligently and avoid shooting ourselves in the foot.</p>

        <p>The challenge is to achieve these benefits while minimizing the weight of our solutions and making the most of what the platform provides.</p>

        <p>Within this problem space, as always, there’s plenty of room for innovation and opinion. For our part, we aim to treat the platform as the framework, adding value in the form of lightweight, optional “sugaring” of platform APIs; loosely coupled, interoperable modules; and effective patterns for composing components and applications from smaller building blocks.</p>

        <h2 class="underline">Our role</h2>

        <p>Returning to our mission, here’s how we see our role:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><p>Strongly advocate a platform-centric approach to building modern web apps</p></li>

          <li><p>Build libraries and tools to support app developers in adopting a platform-centric approach</p></li>

          <li><p>In doing so, explore and exemplify best practices for designing platform-centric libraries and tools</p></li>

          <li><p>Based on our own experiences and those of the broader community, continue to influence the evolution of the platform from within the Chrome organization</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>We believe the patterns, libraries and tools we work on are beneficial, and we're happy to see them widely adopted.</p>

        <p>But our campaign to <strong>#UseThePlatform</strong> is ultimately not about driving people to use the stuff the Polymer Project builds. It’s about promoting the use of the web platform to deliver the best apps possible, and helping to ensure that web users and developers get everything they deserve from the platform in the future.</p>
